# misfit-dashboard

Misfit Dashboard is a project of my own aimed to show users' activity data with great and comprehensive visualizations.

## Building the project

```
npm install && bower install
gulp
```

In order to make requests to the Misfit API, it's necessary to register the app and update the `src/js/config.js` file by replacing the fake `XXXXX` app key / client ID.
